> We have discussed main questions raised on Elixir Usersâ€™ Survey 2016 created by Josh Adams.

Full demo of Elixir/Phoenix application deployment on Heroku: Cloud Application Platform (https://www.heroku.com/) was shown.
Main goal is to share experience got when deploying application with Elixir+Phoenix on enterprise cloud application platform, difficulties encountered and how we can deal with them. Also we discussed future goals and ideas for future presentations.
